# SQL_Learning
Here’s a **detailed explanation of SQL Commands** broken down by their types, including syntax, examples, and when to use each command:

---

## **SQL Commands**  

SQL commands are grouped into **categories** based on their functionality. These categories include **DDL, DML, and DCL**.

---

### **1. Data Definition Language (DDL)**  

DDL commands are used to define or modify the structure of database objects like tables, schemas, indexes, or constraints. These commands do not manipulate data but define how data is stored.

#### **Commands**:  

- **CREATE**: Used to create a database, table, or other objects.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1 datatype constraint,
        column2 datatype constraint,
        ...
    );
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR(50),
        HireDate DATE
    );
    ```  

- **ALTER**: Used to modify an existing table’s structure by adding, modifying, or deleting columns.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD column_name datatype;
    ```  
    **Example (Add a column)**:  
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Employees
    ADD Department VARCHAR(50);
    ```  
    **Example (Modify a column)**:  
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Employees
    ALTER COLUMN LastName VARCHAR(100);
    ```  
    **Example (Drop a column)**:  
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Employees
    DROP COLUMN Department;
    ```  

- **DROP**: Deletes an entire database or table permanently.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE Employees;
    ```  

- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table without deleting its structure. It’s faster than `DELETE`.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
    ```  

---

### **2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)**  

DML commands are used to manipulate the data within the database. These commands allow adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.  

#### **Commands**:  

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from a table.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE HireDate > '2022-01-01';
    ```  

- **INSERT**: Adds new records into a table.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate)
    VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-05-12');
    ```  

- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    UPDATE Employees
    SET HireDate = '2023-06-01'
    WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    ```  

- **DELETE**: Removes specific records from a table.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    ```  

> **Note**: `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE` differ in scope. `TRUNCATE` removes all rows quickly, whereas `DELETE` allows removing specific rows based on conditions.

---

### **3. Data Control Language (DCL)**  

DCL commands manage user permissions and control access to database objects.  

#### **Commands**:  

- **GRANT**: Assigns specific privileges to users.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    GRANT privilege_name ON object_name TO user_name;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO User1;
    ```  

- **REVOKE**: Removes previously granted privileges from users.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    REVOKE privilege_name ON object_name FROM user_name;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM User1;
    ```  

- **DENY**: Explicitly denies a user permission, overriding any `GRANT`.  
    **Syntax**:  
    ```sql
    DENY privilege_name ON object_name TO user_name;
    ```  
    **Example**:  
    ```sql
    DENY INSERT ON Employees TO User1;
    ```  

---

### **Key Differences Between DDL, DML, and DCL**  

| **Type** | **Purpose**                         | **Commands**                             | **Examples**                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **DDL**  | Define or modify database structure | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`    | Create a new table, alter a column, drop a table |
| **DML**  | Manipulate data within tables       | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`   | Retrieve data, add new rows, update values |
| **DCL**  | Manage user permissions             | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `DENY`                | Grant select access, revoke update access |

---

By mastering these commands, you can efficiently manage both the structure and the data of relational databases, as well as secure them with proper permissions. Let me know if you'd like to expand on any command further!


# SQL Views: Detailed Notes

### What is a SQL View?
- A **view** is a virtual table in SQL that is based on the result of a `SELECT` query. 
- It does not store data physically; instead, it displays data stored in other tables based on the query definition.
- Views are used to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and improve reusability in database operations.

---

### Features of SQL Views
1. **Virtual Table**: It is not a physical table but behaves like one. Data is dynamically fetched from the underlying table(s) every time the view is queried.
2. **Data Abstraction**: Views abstract the complexity of the underlying database schema.
3. **Reusability**: A single view can be used in multiple queries without rewriting the complex logic it encapsulates.
4. **Security**: Views can restrict access to specific rows or columns of a table by exposing only the necessary data.

---

### Syntax for Creating a View
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Explanation**:
- `CREATE VIEW`: Keyword to create a new view.
- `view_name`: The name assigned to the view.
- `SELECT`: Query to specify the data that the view will return.

---

### Example: Creating a View
Assume we have a table called `Orders`:

| OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate   | TotalAmount |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1       | 101        | 2025-01-10  | 250         |
| 2       | 102        | 2025-01-11  | 150         |
| 3       | 101        | 2025-01-12  | 350         |

#### Create a View to Show Orders Above $200
```sql
CREATE VIEW HighValueOrders AS
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE TotalAmount > 200;
```

#### Querying the View
```sql
SELECT * FROM HighValueOrders;
```

**Output**:
| OrderID | CustomerID | TotalAmount |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1       | 101        | 250         |
| 3       | 101        | 350         |

---

### Benefits of Using Views
1. **Simplification**: Views simplify repetitive or complex queries, reducing errors and improving readability.
2. **Data Security**: Restrict user access to sensitive data by creating views that display only required fields.
3. **Logical Separation**: Abstract database structure changes, so applications using the view remain unaffected if the base tables are altered.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency across queries using the same view definition.
5. **Reusability**: Views allow reuse of complex queries in different contexts.

---

### Types of Views
1. **Simple Views**: 
   - Based on a single table.
   - Do not use functions, joins, or subqueries.
   - Can only retrieve data.

   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW CustomerOrders AS
   SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate
   FROM Orders;
   ```

2. **Complex Views**:
   - Based on multiple tables.
   - Can include joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, etc.
   - Allow more sophisticated data presentation.

   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW OrderSummary AS
   SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName, SUM(Orders.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
   FROM Customers
   INNER JOIN Orders
   ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
   GROUP BY Customers.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName;
   ```

---

### Updating Data via Views
- **Updatable Views**: Some views allow data updates, provided they meet specific criteria:
  - The view must reference only one base table.
  - The view should not include aggregate functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or UNION.
  - Columns in the `SELECT` statement must directly map to table columns.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW CustomerDetails AS
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, Email
FROM Customers;

-- Update using the view
UPDATE CustomerDetails
SET Email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE CustomerID = 101;
```

- **Non-Updatable Views**: Complex views with joins or aggregate functions cannot be directly updated.

---

### Modifying and Deleting Views
1. **Modify a View**:
   Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` to update the definition of an existing view:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW HighValueOrders AS
   SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, TotalAmount
   FROM Orders
   WHERE TotalAmount > 300;
   ```

2. **Delete a View**:
   Use `DROP VIEW` to remove a view from the database:
   ```sql
   DROP VIEW HighValueOrders;
   ```

---

### SQL View Best Practices
1. Use views to enforce consistent query logic across multiple parts of the application.
2. Name views descriptively to reflect the purpose of the data they present.
3. Avoid overly complex views that can lead to poor performance.
4. Use indexed columns in the underlying tables to optimize view performance.
5. Keep views up to date with changes in the underlying database schema.

---

### Limitations of Views
1. Performance Overhead: Views do not store data physically; querying a view involves fetching data from the base tables every time.
2. Restrictions on Updates: Views with joins, aggregate functions, or subqueries cannot be updated directly.
3. Schema Dependency: Changes to base table structure can break dependent views.

---

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Business Reporting**: Simplify data retrieval for analysts and stakeholders.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive columns by creating views tailored for specific user roles.
3. **Data Aggregation**: Present summary data (e.g., total sales, average revenue) using aggregate functions in views.

--- 

### Conclusion
SQL views are a powerful feature for simplifying data access, improving security, and providing reusable abstractions in relational databases. Proper use of views enhances database maintainability and performance in real-world applications.

# SQL Transactions: Detailed Notes

### What is a Transaction?
- A **transaction** in SQL is a sequence of one or more operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that are executed as a single unit of work.
- Transactions ensure the reliability and integrity of database operations, especially in scenarios involving concurrent access or failure recovery.
- A transaction is **atomic**, meaning it is treated as a single, indivisible operation—either all steps are successfully executed, or none are applied.

---

### ACID Properties of Transactions
Transactions are governed by the **ACID** properties to ensure consistency and reliability:

1. **Atomicity**:
   - Ensures all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database in its original state.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction. Rules such as constraints and triggers are maintained.

3. **Isolation**:
   - Ensures that transactions are executed independently of each other. Partial updates from one transaction are not visible to others until the transaction is committed.

4. **Durability**:
   - Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

---

### Syntax for Transactions

1. **Start a Transaction**:
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   ```

2. **Perform Operations**:
   Include one or more SQL commands (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

3. **Commit the Transaction**:
   Saves all changes to the database.
   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```

4. **Rollback the Transaction**:
   Undoes changes made during the transaction if an error occurs.
   ```sql
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

---

### Example: Using Transactions
#### Scenario: Bank Transfer
You want to transfer $500 from Account A to Account B. Both accounts should be updated as a single transaction to ensure consistency.

Assume the table `Accounts`:

| AccountID | AccountHolder | Balance |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1         | John          | 1000    |
| 2         | Jane          | 1500    |

#### SQL Code:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct $500 from John’s account
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 500
WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Add $500 to Jane’s account
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 500
WHERE AccountID = 2;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

If any of these operations fail (e.g., insufficient balance in John's account), a `ROLLBACK` can be executed to undo all changes.

---

### Using ROLLBACK to Handle Errors
#### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct $500 from John's account
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 500
WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Simulate an error (e.g., no matching record for AccountID 3)
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 500
WHERE AccountID = 3;

-- Rollback the transaction if an error occurs
ROLLBACK;
```

**Outcome**:
- No changes are made to the `Accounts` table because the transaction is rolled back after the error.

---

### Savepoints in Transactions
- **Savepoints** allow partial rollbacks within a transaction by creating checkpoints.
- Use `SAVEPOINT` to define a point to which you can roll back.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Deduct $500 from John’s account
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 500
WHERE AccountID = 1;

SAVEPOINT AfterDeduction;

-- Step 2: Add $500 to Jane’s account
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 500
WHERE AccountID = 2;

-- If an error occurs here, rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO AfterDeduction;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

---

### Isolation Levels in Transactions
To manage **concurrent transactions**, SQL defines different isolation levels. These levels determine how transactions interact with each other and what data is visible during execution.

1. **Read Uncommitted**:
   - Transactions can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.
   - Risk: **Dirty reads** (reading uncommitted or inconsistent data).

2. **Read Committed** (Default for many databases):
   - Transactions can only read committed data.
   - Prevents dirty reads.

3. **Repeatable Read**:
   - Ensures that if a transaction reads the same row multiple times, the data does not change during the transaction.
   - Prevents dirty reads and **non-repeatable reads** (data changes during the transaction).

4. **Serializable**:
   - The highest isolation level.
   - Ensures complete isolation by preventing other transactions from accessing the affected rows until the transaction completes.
   - Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and **phantom reads** (new rows are added by another transaction during the current one).

#### Syntax to Set Isolation Level:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Perform operations
COMMIT;
```

---

### Advantages of Transactions
1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures data remains consistent and reliable.
2. **Error Handling**: Allows undoing operations when errors occur.
3. **Concurrency Control**: Manages simultaneous transactions to avoid conflicts.

---

### Limitations of Transactions
1. **Performance Overhead**: Transactions, especially at higher isolation levels, can reduce database performance.
2. **Deadlocks**: Simultaneous transactions may block each other, causing a deadlock.
3. **Requires Proper Design**: Poor transaction management can lead to data inconsistencies or performance issues.

---

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **E-Commerce**:
   - Updating inventory and order status in a single transaction.
2. **Banking**:
   - Ensuring funds are debited from one account and credited to another atomically.
3. **Ticket Booking Systems**:
   - Reserving a seat and deducting payment simultaneously.

---

### Conclusion
Transactions are critical for maintaining data consistency, integrity, and reliability in relational databases. By adhering to ACID properties and using features like savepoints and isolation levels, SQL transactions ensure robust and error-resilient database operations.

# SQL JOIN Clause: Detailed Notes with Relatable Analogies

### What is a JOIN Clause?
The SQL `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It helps you retrieve meaningful data from multiple tables as if they were a single table.

---

### Analogy: Connecting Pieces of a Puzzle
Imagine two puzzle pieces: one piece has part of a picture, and the other has the matching part. The `JOIN` clause connects these pieces to form the complete picture. Similarly, in databases, different tables store different pieces of information, and `JOIN` combines them to create a unified view.

---

### Types of Joins and Analogies
Here are the types of joins, explained with relatable analogies:

#### 1. **INNER JOIN**: "The Common Ground"
- Combines rows where there is a match in both tables based on the condition specified in the `ON` clause.
- If there's no match, those rows are excluded.

**Analogy**: 
- Imagine two groups of friends attending a party. One group brings food, and the other brings drinks. `INNER JOIN` is like forming pairs where one person has food and the other has drinks. People who don't have matches don't join the fun.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

**Explanation**:
- This query retrieves order IDs and customer names for orders that have matching customer IDs in both the `Orders` and `Customers` tables.

**Result**:
Only orders with valid customers are included.

---

#### 2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: "Include Everyone from the Left"
- Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
- If there’s no match, the result includes `NULL` values for columns from the right table.

**Analogy**:
- Think of a classroom where every student (left table) gets their grades (right table). If a student hasn't received a grade yet, their name is listed, but the grade column is empty.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Explanation**:
- This query retrieves all customers and their corresponding orders. If a customer hasn't placed an order, their name will still appear, but the `OrderID` will show `NULL`.

---

#### 3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: "Include Everyone from the Right"
- Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
- If there’s no match, the result includes `NULL` values for columns from the left table.

**Analogy**:
- Imagine assigning tasks (right table) to employees (left table). Some tasks might not yet have an employee assigned. `RIGHT JOIN` ensures all tasks are listed, even if they don't have an assignee.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

**Explanation**:
- This query retrieves all orders and their corresponding customer names. If an order is unlinked to a customer, the customer name will show as `NULL`.

---

#### 4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: "Include Everyone from Both Sides"
- Combines all rows from both tables.
- If there’s a match, the rows are merged. If no match exists, `NULL` values are returned for the missing data.

**Analogy**:
- Think of two teams (left table and right table) participating in a tournament. Some players from each team show up, while others don’t. `FULL JOIN` lists everyone, whether they played or not, and mentions their contribution.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Explanation**:
- This query retrieves all customers and all orders. It includes customers without orders and orders without customers, filling missing values with `NULL`.

---

### Real-Life Use Case Examples

1. **INNER JOIN Example**:
   - **Scenario**: A retail store wants to know which customers made purchases.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
     FROM Customers
     INNER JOIN Orders
     ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
     ```
   - **Result**: Only customers who placed orders are shown.

2. **LEFT JOIN Example**:
   - **Scenario**: A school wants to list all students and their corresponding grades, even for those who haven't received grades.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Students.StudentName, Grades.Grade
     FROM Students
     LEFT JOIN Grades
     ON Students.StudentID = Grades.StudentID;
     ```
   - **Result**: All students are listed, with `NULL` for those without grades.

3. **RIGHT JOIN Example**:
   - **Scenario**: A project manager wants a list of all tasks and the employees assigned to them. If a task is unassigned, it should still appear.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Tasks.TaskName, Employees.EmployeeName
     FROM Tasks
     RIGHT JOIN Employees
     ON Tasks.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID;
     ```

4. **FULL JOIN Example**:
   - **Scenario**: A health system wants to list all patients and all appointments, even if some patients haven’t booked appointments or some appointments aren’t linked to patients.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Patients.PatientName, Appointments.AppointmentDate
     FROM Patients
     FULL JOIN Appointments
     ON Patients.PatientID = Appointments.PatientID;
     ```

---

### Summary Table of Joins

| **Join Type**   | **Description**                                      | **Result**                                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN**   | Matches rows in both tables.                         | Only matching rows from both tables.                                                     |
| **LEFT JOIN**    | Includes all rows from the left table.               | Matching rows from both tables + unmatched rows from the left table with `NULL` values.  |
| **RIGHT JOIN**   | Includes all rows from the right table.              | Matching rows from both tables + unmatched rows from the right table with `NULL` values. |
| **FULL JOIN**    | Includes all rows from both tables.                  | All rows, with `NULL` values where there is no match.                                     |

---

### Important Notes
1. Joins can work on multiple tables, not just two.
2. Performance can degrade with complex joins or large datasets. Optimize with proper indexing.
3. Always use `ON` to specify the condition for joining tables.
4. If using ambiguous column names (e.g., `CustomerID` in multiple tables), prefix them with the table name (e.g., `Customers.CustomerID`).

---

### Practice Query
**Scenario**: A company tracks employees and their project assignments in separate tables. Write queries to:
1. List all employees and their projects (`LEFT JOIN`).
2. List all projects and the employees assigned to them (`RIGHT JOIN`).
3. List only employees assigned to projects (`INNER JOIN`).
4. List all employees and projects, even if there’s no match (`FULL JOIN`).

This practice helps solidify your understanding of joins!

# SQL Constraints: Detailed Notes

### What are SQL Constraints?
SQL constraints are rules enforced on columns in a table to ensure the validity, integrity, and reliability of the data stored in the database. Constraints restrict the type of data that can be inserted into a table and ensure consistency across the database.

---

### Types of SQL Constraints

1. **NOT NULL**:
   - Ensures that a column cannot have `NULL` values.
   - Useful for columns where data is mandatory, such as primary keys or required fields.
   - Applied at the column level.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT NOT NULL,
       Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `EmployeeID` and `Name` columns must always contain values.

---

2. **UNIQUE**:
   - Ensures that all values in a column are distinct (no duplicates).
   - Can be applied at the column or table level.
   - Multiple `UNIQUE` constraints can be applied in a table.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: No two employees can have the same email address.

---

3. **PRIMARY KEY**:
   - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
   - Combines `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints.
   - A table can only have one primary key, but it can consist of multiple columns (composite key).

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderDate DATE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `OrderID` column uniquely identifies each order and cannot be null.

   **Composite Key Example**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
       OrderID INT,
       ProductID INT,
       PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
   );
   ```

---

4. **FOREIGN KEY**:
   - Establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table (child table) to the primary key in another table (parent table).
   - Enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the value in the foreign key column exists in the referenced table.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table must match a `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table.

---

5. **CHECK**:
   - Ensures that column values meet specific conditions.
   - Applied at the column or table level.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `Age` column must contain values greater than or equal to 18.

   **Table-Level Example**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Products (
       Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       Discount DECIMAL(5, 2),
       CHECK (Discount <= Price)
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `Discount` cannot exceed the `Price`.

---

6. **DEFAULT**:
   - Assigns a default value to a column if no value is provided during an insert operation.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE()
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: If no value is provided for `OrderDate`, the current date will be used.

---

### Example Table with Multiple Constraints
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,            -- Uniquely identifies each customer
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,            -- Name cannot be NULL
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,             -- Email must be unique
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE,        -- PhoneNumber must be unique
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),             -- Age must be 18 or above
    Country VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Kenya'    -- Default value for Country is 'Kenya'
);
```

---

### Adding Constraints to Existing Tables

1. **Adding a `NOT NULL` Constraint**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   MODIFY Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
   ```

2. **Adding a `UNIQUE` Constraint**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Email UNIQUE (Email);
   ```

3. **Adding a `PRIMARY KEY`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID);
   ```

4. **Adding a `FOREIGN KEY`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Orders
   ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Customer FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID)
   REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID);
   ```

5. **Adding a `CHECK` Constraint**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Age CHECK (Age >= 18);
   ```

6. **Adding a `DEFAULT` Value**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   MODIFY Country VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Kenya';
   ```

---

### Dropping Constraints

1. **Drop a Primary Key**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   DROP PRIMARY KEY;
   ```

2. **Drop a Foreign Key**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Orders
   DROP CONSTRAINT FK_Customer;
   ```

3. **Drop a Unique Constraint**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Email;
   ```

4. **Drop a Check Constraint**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Customers
   DROP CONSTRAINT CHK_Age;
   ```

---

### Advantages of Constraints
1. **Data Integrity**:
   - Prevents invalid or inconsistent data.
2. **Error Prevention**:
   - Ensures proper values are entered into the database.
3. **Automation**:
   - Reduces the need for manual validation in application code.
4. **Relationship Enforcement**:
   - Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables.

---

### Limitations of Constraints
1. **Reduced Flexibility**:
   - Constraints may prevent certain data from being entered if business rules change.
2. **Performance Impact**:
   - Some constraints (e.g., foreign keys) can slow down operations like INSERT or DELETE.
3. **Complexity**:
   - Managing constraints in large databases with many tables can become complex.

---

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **NOT NULL**:
   - Ensuring required fields like `username` or `email` are always filled.
2. **UNIQUE**:
   - Ensuring no duplicate entries for critical fields like `email` or `SSN`.
3. **PRIMARY KEY**:
   - Uniquely identifying customers or orders.
4. **FOREIGN KEY**:
   - Linking orders to customers or products.
5. **CHECK**:
   - Enforcing business rules, such as minimum salary or maximum discount.
6. **DEFAULT**:
   - Automatically assigning default values for optional fields like `status = 'active'`.

---

### Conclusion
SQL constraints are vital for ensuring data integrity and enforcing business rules within a database. By combining these constraints strategically, developers can design robust and reliable database schemas that prevent errors and maintain consistency.

# 11. **Indexing in SQL**

### What is Indexing?
- Indexing in SQL improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
- An **index** is a special data structure that allows the database to locate specific rows faster, much like an index in a book helps you quickly find a specific topic.

---

### How Indexing Works
- Without an index, the database scans the entire table (full table scan) to locate the required data.
- With an index, the database can directly jump to the relevant rows, reducing the time taken for queries.

---

### Analogy: An Index in a Book
Imagine looking for a specific chapter in a 500-page book:
- Without an index: You flip through every page until you find the chapter (full table scan).
- With an index: You look at the index page, find the chapter number, and jump directly to it.

---

### Types of Indexes
1. **Unique Index**:
   - Ensures that no two rows in the table have the same value in the indexed column(s).
   - Useful for columns like email, usernames, etc.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON Users (Email);
   ```

2. **Clustered Index**:
   - Physically organizes table data based on the index.
   - A table can have only one clustered index.
   - Typically created automatically for the primary key.

3. **Non-Clustered Index**:
   - Creates a separate structure to store index data and references to the table rows.
   - A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

   **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_orderID ON Orders (OrderID);
   ```

---

### Syntax for Creating an Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orderDate ON Orders (OrderDate);
```
- This creates an index on the `OrderDate` column in the `Orders` table, making queries like `WHERE OrderDate = '2024-01-26'` faster.

---

### Managing Indexes
- **Dropping an Index**:
  ```sql
  DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;
  ```

- **Checking Index Usage**:
  Use database-specific tools or `EXPLAIN` in queries to check if indexes are being used efficiently.

---

### Trade-Offs of Indexing
1. **Pros**:
   - Faster data retrieval.
   - Improved query performance, especially for large tables.

2. **Cons**:
   - Slows down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations as the index needs to be updated.
   - Consumes additional disk space.

# 12. **SQL Subqueries**

### What is a Subquery?
- A subquery is a query nested inside another query.
- It allows you to perform complex queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.

---

### Analogy: Delegating Tasks
Imagine a manager asking one employee (subquery) to prepare a report, and then another employee (outer query) uses that report to complete their work.

---

### How Subqueries Work
- The **inner query (subquery)** is executed first, and its result is passed to the **outer query**.
- Subqueries can be used in:
  - `WHERE` clauses to filter data.
  - `SELECT` statements to compute derived values.
  - `FROM` clauses as inline views.

---

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name OPERATOR (
    SELECT column_name
    FROM another_table
    WHERE condition
);
```

---

### Types of Subqueries
1. **Single-Row Subquery**:
   - Returns a single value.
   - Used with comparison operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, etc.

   **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeName
   FROM Employees
   WHERE Salary > (
       SELECT AVG(Salary)
       FROM Employees
   );
   ```
   - Retrieves employees earning above the average salary.

2. **Multi-Row Subquery**:
   - Returns multiple rows.
   - Used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`.

   **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerName
   FROM Customers
   WHERE CustomerID IN (
       SELECT CustomerID
       FROM Orders
       WHERE OrderDate = '2024-01-01'
   );
   ```
   - Finds customers who placed orders on January 1, 2024.

3. **Correlated Subquery**:
   - Refers to columns in the outer query and is executed repeatedly for each row of the outer query.
   - Slower but useful for specific scenarios.

   **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeName
   FROM Employees E1
   WHERE Salary > (
       SELECT AVG(Salary)
       FROM Employees E2
       WHERE E1.DepartmentID = E2.DepartmentID
   );
   ```
   - Lists employees earning above the average salary of their department.

4. **Subquery in the FROM Clause**:
   - Acts as a temporary table or derived table.

   **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(TotalSales)
   FROM (
       SELECT SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
       FROM Orders
       GROUP BY CustomerID
   ) AS CustomerSales;
   ```
   - Calculates the average total sales for all customers.

---

### Best Practices for Subqueries
1. Avoid using subqueries when a `JOIN` can achieve the same result more efficiently.
2. Use indexing on columns referenced in subqueries to improve performance.
3. Keep subqueries simple and specific for clarity and efficiency.

---

### Trade-Offs of Subqueries
1. **Pros**:
   - Simplifies complex queries.
   - Can solve problems that are difficult to address with standard joins.

2. **Cons**:
   - Can be slower than `JOIN` for large datasets.
   - Correlated subqueries are particularly resource-intensive.

---

### Real-Life Example: Subquery
**Scenario**: Find the products whose price is above the average price of all products.

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (
    SELECT AVG(Price)
    FROM Products
);
```
